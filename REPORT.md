## v1.3 Evidence and Incident Capability

What changed:

- Added `EvidenceItem`, `EvidenceBundle`, `Finding`, `Incident`, `GenerationMetadata`, and `LLMAssessment` schemas.
- Added `LLMGuardrails` for evidence references, deterministic downgrade protection, unilateral `BLOCK` caution, attack-type allowlisting, and confidence sanity.
- Added `auth_success` normalization in the log pipeline.
- Added deterministic time-window and sequence correlation for `possible_account_compromise`.
- Added JSON Incident Report export utilities.
- Added report-aware follow-up helpers for EV-ID / F-ID lookup and report explanation.
- Added evidence-grounded LLMAssist fallback/advisory assessment with guardrail validation.
- Added Scenario A mixed authentication demo log and integration coverage.
- Added 11 `report_explainer` KB docs for report-aware explanation.

Verification:

- `python -m pytest` -> `102 passed`
- `python -m ruff check .` -> passed
- `python -m mypy app.py modules tests` -> passed

Representative Scenario A:

```text
Mixed auth log
-> parse / normalize
-> time-window + sequence correlation
-> possible_account_compromise
-> Risk Level: HIGH
-> Decision: MONITOR
-> JSON Incident Report
-> EV-003 follow-up explanation
-> LLMAssist advisory assessment with guardrails
```

Boundary note:

This is not confirmed compromise. `MONITOR` means analyst review / simulated monitoring. The prototype does not perform real firewall, WAF, EDR, SIEM, or SOAR action. LLMAssist remains advisory and cannot override the deterministic final decision.

---

## v1.4 Detection-as-Code Lite

What changed:

- Added `modules/detection_rules.py` for the `DetectionRule` schema.
- Added `modules/rule_loader.py` for YAML rule loading and schema validation.
- Added YAML rules under `detections/blue_team/`.
- Updated the detector adapter so YAML rules are the primary path.
- Exposed rule metadata in detector results.

Supported YAML rule files:

- `xss_basic.yml`
- `sql_injection_basic.yml`
- `path_traversal_basic.yml`
- `command_injection_basic.yml`

Verification:

- `python -m pytest` -> `141 passed`
- `python -m ruff check .` -> passed
- `python -m mypy app.py modules tests` -> passed

Boundary note:

YAML rules are the primary deterministic detection path. Hard-coded signatures remain as a conservative fallback. No real firewall, WAF, EDR, SIEM, SOAR, or cloud enforcement is performed.

---

## v1.5 ControllerAgent and Tool Registry

What changed:

- Added typed ControllerAgent infrastructure for future agent skill orchestration.
- Added `ToolRegistry`, six `ToolSpec` entries, thin skill wrappers, and deterministic route dispatch.
- Verified `ToolRegistry` + Skill Catalog + Skill Wrappers together through `ControllerAgent` integration tests.
- Kept `ControllerAgent` isolated from `app.py` and the current CLI runtime.

Boundary note:

This milestone does not change existing CLI behavior. `ControllerAgent` dispatches only by explicit route or tool name; it does not perform LLM routing, free-form input classification, Auto Route, or Smart Router behavior.

v1.5 verification:

- `python -m pytest` -> `240 passed`
- `python -m ruff check .` -> passed
- `python -m mypy app.py modules tests` -> passed

## v1.6 RAG v2 Foundation

v1.6 update:

- Added source-cited RAG v2 helper infrastructure for traceable report and rule explanations.
- Added RAG v2 boundary models, metadata parsing, rule-based intent classification, exact ID extraction, metadata-aware planning, source assembly, and deterministic Report Explainer v2 / Rule Explainer v2 helpers.
- Added frontmatter metadata support for the 11 `report_explainer` docs.
- Kept these helpers isolated from the existing `modules/rag_qa.py` runtime and CLI paths.
- Quality gate: `python -m pytest` -> `366 passed`; `python -m ruff check .` -> passed; `python -m mypy app.py modules tests` -> passed.

v1.6 boundary note:

This milestone improves RAG traceability and explainability; it is not a runtime RAG replacement. Existing CLI behavior remains unchanged. RAG v2 helpers are deterministic and test-covered. RAG does not become a detection source, and the final verdict remains deterministic and policy-controlled.

## v1.7 Answer Safety / Evaluation / Smart Router Foundation

v1.7 adds reliability infrastructure before user-facing router activation.

What changed:

- Added eval cases for answer safety, report QA, router routing, and payload detection.
- Added deterministic AnswerGuardrails for unsafe claims such as real enforcement, RAG as detection source, LLM final verdict override, and MONITOR as confirmed compromise.
- Added deterministic Evaluation Runner smoke checks.
- Added an isolated rule-based Smart Router route decision helper.
- Added CI Gitleaks secret scanning and moved reusable log ingestion runner code into `modules/`.

Boundary note:

Smart Router classifies input into finalized route categories, but it is not wired into the CLI yet and does not execute tools. Existing CLI behavior remains unchanged. AnswerGuardrails are deterministic checks, not an LLM safety classifier. The quality gate is `445 passed`, with ruff and mypy passing.

## v1.8 Protected Runtime Wiring and Analyst UX

v1.8 starts narrow protected integration, not broad runtime replacement.

What changed:

- Added protected report/rule explanation helpers that use existing RAG v2 helpers and AnswerGuardrails.
- Refined unsafe helper output to return conservative Traditional Chinese fallback wording.
- Added Smart Router preview mode for route decisions only; it does not execute tools.
- Added deterministic analyst follow-up suggestions, not LLM-generated suggestions.
- Kept existing CLI behavior unchanged.

Boundary note:

`RAGQA` remains the active general knowledge QA runtime. Smart Router preview is not the default CLI path. No LLM routing, final verdict override, Investigation Planner, or real firewall/WAF/SIEM/SOAR enforcement is introduced. The quality gate is `487 passed`, with ruff and mypy passing.

## v1.9 Architecture Cleanup and Orchestration Contracts

v1.9 is an engineering milestone for architecture cleanup and orchestration contracts, not a runtime feature release.

What changed:

- Added `docs/v1.9-spec.md` as the detailed v1.9 design source of truth.
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md` for runtime, helper, staged, eval, and docs ownership.
- Added ADRs for deterministic ControllerAgent behavior, follow-up boundaries, RAGQA/RAG helper coexistence, Tool Permission Model, and Workflow Plan Model.
- Added schema-only Tool Permission Contract and tests.
- Added schema-only Workflow Plan Contract and tests.
- Added Testing Strategy and Package Migration Plan documentation.
- Migrated RAG helper modules into `modules/rag/` with flat compatibility shims.
- Migrated controller/orchestration modules into `modules/controller/` with flat compatibility shims.
- Added manual LLM/RAG smoke checklist documentation as manual-only, not CI, and not executed.

Boundary note:

Tool Policy and Workflow Plan are contract-only. They are not connected to runtime flow, do not execute tools, and do not make Smart Router the default CLI route. `ControllerAgent` does not auto-execute. `RAGQA` remains the active general knowledge QA runtime. Graph RAG, Knowledge Capture, and Agent Skill Orchestration runtime remain deferred. AI does not decide attacks or override Risk Level / Decision. `BLOCK`, `MONITOR`, and `ALLOW` remain simulated, with no real firewall/WAF/SIEM/SOAR enforcement. The quality gate is `537 passed`, with ruff, mypy, and `git diff --check` passing.

## v2.0 Knowledge Graph Foundation

v2.0 adds deterministic graph helper infrastructure, not runtime graph retrieval.

What changed:

- Added typed graph contracts: `GraphNodeKind`, `GraphEdgeKind`, `GraphSourceRef`, `GraphNode`, `GraphEdge`, and `GraphSnapshot`.
- Added `build_graph_snapshot(...)` for structured `Incident` objects and explicitly provided `DetectionRule` objects.
- Added read-only graph lookup helpers: `get_node`, `get_neighbors`, `get_edges_for_node`, `find_nodes_by_kind`, `get_related_findings`, `get_related_rules`, and `get_incident_context`.
- Added JSON-serializable graph export helpers: `graph_snapshot_to_dict` and `graph_snapshot_to_json`.
- Recorded the 2A-3 decision: no `rule_graph.py` for now, explicit `DetectionRule` seed remains inside the builder, and KnowledgeDoc graph seed is deferred until a metadata audit.

Boundary note:

The graph is evidence/context structure, not detection authority. It does not load YAML or files, infer relationships from free text, call LLM/RAG/vector systems, execute tools, replace `RAGQA`, replace the Rule-Based Detector, write knowledge, or change Risk Level / Decision. `BLOCK`, `MONITOR`, and `ALLOW` remain simulated, and deterministic detector / risk / decision remain final authority. The v2.0 release gate has not been run in this documentation sync.

### v1.4 Detection-as-Code Lite / YAML 規則式偵測

v1.4 將 XSS、SQL Injection、Path Traversal、Command Injection 的 payload signatures 移至 `detections/blue_team/` YAML 規則。系統新增 `DetectionRule` schema 與 YAML rule loader，detector adapter 以 YAML 作為主要偵測路徑，並在 detector result 中保留 rule ID、source path、severity、confidence、MITRE techniques 與 references 等 metadata。

此階段仍是 deterministic rule-based detection，不是 ML detection，也不是 LLM-generated rules。Hard-coded signatures 仍保留作為保守 fallback，且不執行任何真實 enforcement。

### v1.3 證據與事件能力

v1.3 將系統從單一事件分析推進到 incident-style evidence handling。系統現在能使用 EV-ID / F-ID 保存證據與 finding，針對 authentication log 進行 time-window sequence correlation，偵測 repeated auth_failure followed by auth_success 的 `possible_account_compromise` 情境，並輸出 JSON Incident Report。

驗證結果：`pytest` 為 `102 passed`，`ruff` 通過，`mypy app.py modules tests` 通過。此判定仍是 deterministic correlation；`possible_account_compromise` 代表可疑但未確認的 compromise，因此 v1.3 預設為 `HIGH / MONITOR`。LLMAssist 只提供 advisory reasoning，並受到 guardrails 限制；最終 decision 不會被 LLM 覆蓋，也不會執行真實 enforcement。

## 1. Report Overview

The current system is an AI-assisted blue-team security triage prototype. It supports:

- Suspicious payload / event analysis
- Single raw log translation
- Log file ingestion and aggregation
- RAG-based security knowledge Q&A
- Follow-up explanation
- Unified `[Security Triage Report]` output

The latest milestone adds the v2.0 Knowledge Graph Foundation: typed graph contracts, a deterministic snapshot builder, read-only graph query helpers, JSON-ready snapshot export, and a decision to defer KnowledgeDoc graph seeding until a metadata audit. Existing CLI runtime and unified Security Triage Report behavior remain unchanged.

---

## 2. System Overview

| Capability | Current Behavior |
|---|---|
| CLI Modes | The menu routes users to payload/event analysis, log file ingestion, security knowledge Q&A, follow-up explanation, or exit. |
| Unified Triage Output | Security analysis results use `[Security Triage Report]` with Quick Verdict, Summary, Evidence, Why It Matters, Recommended Response, Simulation Notice, and AI Assist sections. |
| Payload / Event Analysis | Known suspicious payloads are routed by CLI mode handlers, analyzed by SecurityAgent, scored by `TriagePolicy`, and optionally enriched by `LLMAssist`. |
| Single Raw Log Translation | Raw authentication log lines are handled by the consolidated log pipeline and triaged as authentication failures. |
| Log File Ingestion | Log files are parsed, normalized, aggregated, and adapted by `modules/log_pipeline.py`, then optionally sent to SecurityAgent. |
| Brute Force Candidate Analysis | Repeated authentication failures can aggregate into a `brute_force_candidate` event for SecurityAgent triage. |
| RAG Knowledge Q&A | Mode 3 uses a dedicated knowledge route, `RAGQueryPlanner`, preferred source selection, and Chroma fallback for explanatory answers. |
| Follow-up Explanation | Mode 4 remains available for additional explanation based on previous context. |

---

## 3. Architecture

### A. Payload Flow

```text
User Input
-> CLI Mode Handler
-> SecurityAgent
-> Rule-Based Detector
-> TriagePolicy
-> LLMAssist
-> Security Triage Report
```

### B. Single Raw Log Flow

```text
Raw Log Line
-> Consolidated Log Pipeline
-> Raw Log Translation
-> Authentication Failure Triage Report
```

### C. Log File Flow

```text
Log File
-> Consolidated Log Pipeline
-> Aggregated Event
-> SecurityAgent
-> Security Triage Report
```

### D. RAG QA Flow

```text
Security Question
-> Dedicated Knowledge Q&A route
-> RAGQueryPlanner
-> Preferred source selection / Chroma fallback
-> RAG Answer
```

Mode 3 RAG is used for knowledge explanation only. It does not decide attack type, risk level, or final simulated action.

## 5. Detailed Demo Results

### D01 - Mode 1 XSS Payload

Input:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Observed summary:

```text
[Security Triage Report]

0. Quick Verdict
Verdict: This event is likely XSS.
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Decision: MONITOR
Reason: Matched XSS indicators: <script>, alert(

1. Summary
Status: ALERT
Attack Type: XSS
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Decision: MONITOR
Detection Source: rule_based_detector (rule_based)
```

Evaluation: Passed.

The rule-based path still detects XSS and emits the current unified report format.

### D02 - Mode 1 Single Raw Auth Log

Input:

```text
2026-05-01T10:00:00Z login_failed src_ip=10.0.0.5 user=admin endpoint=/login status=401
```

Observed summary:

```text
[Input Translation]
Detected Input Type: raw_log
Normalized Event Type: auth_failure
Converted SecurityAgent Input:
login failed from source_ip 10.0.0.5 against /login for user admin

[Security Triage Report]

0. Quick Verdict
Verdict: This is a failed login event. A single failure is not enough to confirm brute force.
Risk Level: LOW
Decision: MONITOR

1. Summary
Status: REVIEW
Attack Type: Authentication Failure
Risk Level: LOW
Decision: MONITOR
Detection Source: raw_log_translation
```

Evaluation: Passed.

A single failed login is treated as a reviewable authentication signal, not enough evidence by itself to confirm brute force.

### D03 - Mode 2 auth_bruteforce.log Summary

Input:

```text
demo_logs\auth_bruteforce.log
```

Observed summary:

```text
[Log Ingestion Summary]

Total Lines: 10
Parsed Logs: 10
Normalized Events: 10
Aggregated Events: 1

Detected Event Types:
- auth_failure: 10

Aggregated Finding:
- Event Type: brute_force_candidate
- Source IP: 192.168.1.10
- Target: /login
- Failed Count: 10
```

Evaluation: Passed.

Mode 2 now demonstrates that repeated authentication failures can be aggregated before SecurityAgent analysis.

### D04 - Mode 2 auth_bruteforce.log SecurityAgent Analysis

Observed summary:

```text
[Security Triage Report]

0. Quick Verdict
Verdict: This event is suspicious for Brute Force or Credential Stuffing.
Risk Level: HIGH
Decision: MONITOR

1. Summary
Status: SUSPICIOUS
Attack Type: Brute Force / Credential Stuffing
Risk Level: HIGH
Decision: MONITOR
Detection Source: llm_assist + signal_extraction
```

Evaluation: Passed.

Aggregated failures from the same source and target become suspicious brute-force or credential-stuffing evidence while the final decision remains a simulated `MONITOR`.

### D05 - Mode 3 Brute Force Q&A

Question:

```text
What is brute force?
```

Expected result:

```text
RAG-supported explanation of repeated credential guessing from a blue-team perspective.
```

Evaluation: Passed.

### D06 - Mode 3 Login Failure Analysis Q&A

Question:

```text
How should repeated login failures be analyzed?
```

Expected result:

```text
Mentions time window, source_ip, endpoint, user, HTTP 401 / 403, brute force / credential stuffing, and false-positive considerations.
```

Evaluation: Passed.

### D07 - Mode 3 Security Triage Report Guide

Question:

```text
How should I read a Security Triage Report?
```

Expected result:

```text
Explains the report sections and clarifies that BLOCK, MONITOR, and ALLOW are simulated decisions.
```

Evaluation: Passed.

### D08 - Mode 1 XSS Regression

Input:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

Expected result:

```text
Rule-based XSS report remains stable.
```

Evaluation: Passed.

### D09 - Mode 1 Command Injection Regression

Input:

```text
test; rm -rf /tmp/test
```

Observed summary:

```text
[Security Triage Report]

1. Summary
Status: ALERT
Attack Type: Command Injection
Risk Level: HIGH
Decision: BLOCK
Detection Source: rule_based_detector (rule_based)
```

Evaluation: Passed.

The rule-based detector now recognizes high-signal command injection payload indicators and routes them through the current unified report format.

---

## 6. Quality Foundation

The current branch also includes a small but important quality foundation:

- Architecture consolidation around `SecurityAgent`, `TriagePolicy`, `LLMAssist`, `mode_handlers.py`, `log_pipeline.py`, and `RAGQueryPlanner`
- Expanded golden smoke tests for payload regressions, benign input, malformed raw logs, and empty input
- Direct consolidated log pipeline tests for parsing, normalization, and brute-force aggregation
- Pydantic boundary model tests for `modules/types.py`
- Evidence / incident model, guardrail, correlator, exporter, follow-up, LLMAssist, and Scenario A integration tests
- ControllerAgent unit and integration tests for the six v1.5 wrapper skills
- RAG v2 type, metadata, intent, planner, source assembly, and explainer tests
- AnswerGuardrails, eval case loader, eval runner, and Smart Router tests
- Protected report/rule helper, Smart Router preview, and analyst suggestion tests
- Tool Permission Contract and Workflow Plan Contract tests
- v1.9 documentation source-of-truth docs for architecture ownership, testing strategy, ADRs, and package migration planning
- v2.0 graph type, builder, lookup, and exporter focused tests
- `pytest` for regression checks; last full expected result is `537 passed`
- `ruff` for linting and import hygiene
- Lenient `mypy` as a gradual typing baseline
- GitHub Actions CI for automated quality checks

---

| v2.0 Knowledge Graph Foundation helpers | Focused phase checks passed |
| Quality checks and CI foundation | Passed |

Overall result:

```text
v2.0 Knowledge Graph Foundation helpers are documented and covered by focused tests. Existing CLI behavior remains unchanged, graph helpers are not connected to runtime flow, and deterministic detection / policy still control final verdicts.
```

---

## 8. Key Findings

1. The system now separates a single `auth_failure` from an aggregated `brute_force_candidate`.
2. A single authentication failure is triaged as `REVIEW / LOW / MONITOR`.
3. Aggregated repeated failures can become suspicious Brute Force / Credential Stuffing evidence.
4. Rule-based detections and LLMAssist suggestions now both use the unified `[Security Triage Report]`.
5. Mode 3 RAG QA is no longer driven by the old keyword fallback in the active routing path.
6. RAG is used for security knowledge explanation, while detection, risk, and decision fields remain part of the triage pipeline.

---

## 9. Limitations

This demo remains a functional prototype with the following limitations:

- Not all real-world log formats are supported.
- There is no real firewall, WAF, EDR, or production SIEM action.
- `BLOCK`, `MONITOR`, and `ALLOW` are simulated decisions only.
- LLM suggestions do not override the final system `Decision`.
- RAG is not used for primary detection.
- The current CLI is still menu-based and is not yet a full Main Controller Agent.
- Startup still initializes heavy RAG, embedding, and Chroma components.
- Smart Input Router / Main Controller Agent behavior remains future work.
- `RAGQueryPlanner` improves retrieval, but answer quality still depends on the quality of knowledge files and local LLM output.

For planned future work, see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

本報告記錄代表性的 CLI 流程與 pass/fail 驗證，用來確認目前統一 `Security Triage Report` 契約是否穩定。這不是統計式 benchmark；precision / recall、false positive rate 與 retrieval quality evaluation 會留到後續里程碑。

---

## 1. 報告概述

目前系統是一個 AI-assisted blue-team security triage prototype，支援：

- Suspicious payload / event analysis
- Single raw log translation
- Log file ingestion and aggregation
- RAG-based security knowledge Q&A
- Follow-up explanation
- Unified Security Triage Report

v2.0 新增知識圖譜基礎：圖譜型別契約、決定性圖譜建構器、唯讀查詢輔助函式，以及可序列化為 JSON 的匯出輔助函式。2A-3 決策為不新增 `rule_graph.py`，明確的 `DetectionRule` 種子仍留在 builder 內，KnowledgeDoc 圖譜種子延後到 metadata 盤點後再處理。既有 CLI 執行流程與 `Security Triage Report` 行為維持不變。

---

## 2. 系統概覽

| 能力 | 目前行為 |
|---|---|
| CLI 模式 | 選單可進入 payload / event analysis、log file ingestion、security knowledge Q&A、follow-up explanation 或離開。 |
| 統一分流輸出 | 安全分析結果使用 `[Security Triage Report]`，包含 Quick Verdict、Summary、Evidence、Why It Matters、Recommended Response、Simulation Notice 與 AI Assist。 |
| Payload / Event Analysis | 可疑 payload 由 CLI Mode Handler 送入 `SecurityAgent`，透過 Rule-Based Detector、`TriagePolicy` 與選用 `LLMAssist` 產生報告。 |
| Single Raw Log Translation | 單筆原始 authentication log 由 Consolidated Log Pipeline 轉譯，並以 authentication failure 進行分流。 |
| Log File Ingestion | `modules/log_pipeline.py` 負責解析、正規化、聚合與轉接日誌，再視情況送入 SecurityAgent。 |
| Brute Force Candidate Analysis | 重複登入失敗可聚合為 `brute_force_candidate`，再交由 SecurityAgent 分析。 |
| RAG Knowledge Q&A | Mode 3 使用 `RAGQueryPlanner`、preferred source selection 與 Chroma fallback 提供知識解釋。 |
| Follow-up Explanation | Mode 4 可根據前文提供補充說明。 |

---

## 3. 架構

目前架構使用下列核心元件：

- CLI Mode Handler
- SecurityAgent
- Rule-Based Detector
- TriagePolicy
- LLMAssist
- Consolidated Log Pipeline
- RAGQueryPlanner
- Unified Security Triage Report

整體流程：

```text
使用者輸入
-> CLI Mode Handler
-> SecurityAgent
-> Rule-Based Detector / Consolidated Log Pipeline / RAGQueryPlanner
-> TriagePolicy
-> LLMAssist
-> Unified Security Triage Report
```

Payload flow:

```text
User Input
-> CLI Mode Handler
-> SecurityAgent
-> Rule-Based Detector
-> TriagePolicy
-> LLMAssist
-> Security Triage Report
```

Single raw log flow:

```text
Raw Log Line
-> Consolidated Log Pipeline
-> Raw Log Translation
-> Authentication Failure Triage Report
```

Log file flow:

```text
Log File
-> Consolidated Log Pipeline
-> Aggregated Event
-> SecurityAgent
-> Security Triage Report
```

RAG QA flow:

```text
Security Question
-> Dedicated Knowledge Q&A route
-> RAGQueryPlanner
-> Preferred source selection / Chroma fallback
-> RAG Answer
```

Mode 3 RAG 只負責知識解釋，不決定 attack type、risk level 或模擬 action。

## 5. 品質基礎

此分支已完成下列品質基礎：

- architecture consolidation
- expanded golden smoke tests
- direct consolidated log pipeline tests
- Pydantic boundary model tests
- AnswerGuardrails / eval runner / Smart Router tests
- protected helper / Smart Router preview / analyst suggestion tests
- Tool Permission Contract / Workflow Plan Contract tests
- v2.0 graph type / builder / lookup / exporter focused tests
- `pytest` last full gate (`537 passed`)
- `ruff`
- lenient `mypy`
- GitHub Actions CI

這些檢查讓目前的 demo flow、Pydantic boundary types 與 consolidated architecture 在後續導入 ControllerAgent / Tool Registry 前有更穩定的回歸基礎。

| Mode 2 `brute_force_candidate` SecurityAgent analysis | Passed |
| Mode 3 dedicated knowledge Q&A routing | Passed |
| `RAGQueryPlanner` and preferred source selection | Passed |
| Rule-based Command Injection detection | Passed |
| YAML Detection-as-Code | Passed |
| RAG v2 source-cited explainer helpers | Passed |
| v1.9 architecture cleanup / orchestration contracts | Passed |
| v2.0 Knowledge Graph Foundation helpers | Focused phase checks passed |
| pytest / ruff / mypy / GitHub Actions CI | Passed |

整體結果：

```text
v2.0 知識圖譜基礎輔助函式已完成文件同步，並已有 focused tests 覆蓋。既有 CLI 行為維持不變，graph helpers 尚未接入 runtime，最終判定仍由 deterministic 偵測與 policy 控制。
```

## 7. 主要觀察

1. 系統已能區分單筆 `auth_failure` 與聚合後的 `brute_force_candidate`。
2. 單筆登入失敗會被分流為 `REVIEW / LOW / MONITOR`。
3. 多筆重複登入失敗可形成 Brute Force / Credential Stuffing 的可疑證據。
4. 規則式偵測與 LLMAssist 建議都會透過統一 `[Security Triage Report]` 呈現。
5. Mode 3 RAG QA 已走 dedicated knowledge route 與 `RAGQueryPlanner`。
6. RAG 用於知識解釋；偵測、風險與決策仍由 triage pipeline 產生。

## 8. 限制

- 尚未支援所有真實世界日誌格式。
- 沒有真實 firewall、WAF、EDR 或 production SIEM action。
- `BLOCK`、`MONITOR`、`ALLOW` 都是模擬決策。
- LLMAssist 建議不覆蓋最終系統 `Decision`。
- RAG 不作為主要偵測層。
- 目前 CLI 仍是選單式，尚未成為完整 Main Controller Agent。
- 啟動時仍可能初始化較重的 RAG、embedding 與 Chroma 元件。
- Smart Input Router / Main Controller Agent 仍是未來工作。
- `RAGQueryPlanner` 可改善檢索，但答案品質仍取決於知識檔與本地 LLM 輸出。
